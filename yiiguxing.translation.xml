      <item value="A variation of ImportSelector that runs after all @Configuration beans have been processed. This type of selector can be particularly useful when the selected imports are @Conditional. Implementations can also extend the Ordered interface or use the Order annotation to indicate a precedence against other DeferredImportSelectors. Implementations may also provide an import group which can provide additional sorting and filtering logic across different selectors." />

      <item value="public abstract boolean proxyBeanMethods Specify whether @Bean methods should get proxied in order to enforce bean lifecycle behavior, e.g. to return shared singleton bean instances even in case of direct @Bean method calls in user code. This feature requires method interception, implemented through a runtime-generated CGLIB subclass which comes with limitations such as the configuration class and its methods not being allowed to declare final. The default is true, allowing for 'inter-bean references' within the configuration class as well as for external calls to this configuration's @Bean methods, e.g. from another configuration class. If this is not needed since each of this particular configuration's @Bean methods is self-contained and designed as a plain factory method for container use, switch this flag to false in order to avoid CGLIB subclass processing. Turning off bean method interception effectively processes @Bean methods individually like when declared on non-@Configuration classes, a.k.a. &quot;@Bean Lite Mode&quot; (see @Bean's javadoc). It is therefore behaviorally equivalent to removing the @Configuration stereotype." />

      <item value="Commit the given transaction, with regard to its status. If the transaction has been marked rollback-only programmatically, perform a rollback. If the transaction wasn't a new one, omit the commit for proper participation in the surrounding transaction. If a previous transaction has been suspended to be able to create a new one, resume the previous transaction after committing the new one. Note that when the commit call completes, no matter if normally or throwing an exception, the transaction must be fully completed and cleaned up. No rollback call should be expected in such a case.

For example, an O/R Mapping tool might have tried to flush changes to the database right before commit, with the resulting DataAccessException causing the transaction to fail. The original exception will be propagated to the caller of this commit method in such a case." />
